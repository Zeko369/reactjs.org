React function components return what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed as function arguments (`props` in this example)

**JSX is optional and not required to use React.** Try the [Babel REPL](babel://es5-syntax-example) to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.
